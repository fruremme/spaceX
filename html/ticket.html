            <p>ANYWHERE ON EARTH IN UNDER 1 HOUR</p>
            <p>With Starship and Super Heavy, most international long distance trips would be completed in 30 minutes or less. 
                In addition to vastly increased speed, one great benefit to traveling in space outside of Earth’s atmosphere is the lack of friction as well as turbulence and weather.</p>
            <p>Most journeys taking less than 30 minutes with access to anywhere in the world in an hour or less.</p>

            <h5>MARS & BEYOND</h5>
            <p>THE ROAD TO MAKING HUMANITY MULTIPLANETARY</p>
            <p>At an average distance of 140 million miles, Mars is one of Earth's closest habitable neighbors.
                Mars is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight. It is a little cold, but we can warm it up. </p>
            <p>Its atmosphere is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere. 
                Gravity on Mars is about 38% of that of Earth, so you would be able to lift heavy things and bound around. Furthermore, the day is remarkably close to that of Earth.</p>
